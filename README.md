# TCP_Client_Server

Open chat/client and chat/server in seperate terminal windows and start server first with 'cargo run' then the client with 'cargo run'.

I watched this informative video on Youtube by Tensor Programming You should check them out.  The guy sounds like Norm Macdonald from SNL and goes at a pretty brisk pace just the way I like it.  I am going to try to reconstitute the TCP Server and Client implementations using the standard library in rust from memory.  I am trying to get a deeper understanding of the structure of both Data and program and delineate both from behaviour using a mental model to crompress the complexity into something manageable for me.  I figure if I can do this without reference then I must be going in a prety good direction for learning Rust.
